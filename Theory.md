## Initial considerations

**Fundamental questions**:

- In equilibrium with gas phase O$`_2`$, Which of Pt, PtO, and PtO$`_2`$ is the most stable?
- How should we normalize the energy of the different materials?
- We need a method that includes information about the temperature and pressure of O$`_2`$. 

**Basic concepts**

*Phase:* is a homogeneous region of matter in which there is no spatial variation in average density, energy, composition, or other macroscopic properties.

At constant T and P in a single-component system, the phase that is observed is the one which has the lowest Gibbs free energy per particle, or, equivalently, the lowest chemical potential μ(T, P).
