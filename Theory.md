## Initial considerations

**Fundamental questions**:

- In equilibrium with gas phase O$`_2`$, Which of Pt, PtO, and PtO$`_2`$ is the most stable?
- How should we normalize the energy of the different materials?
- We need a method that includes information about the temperature and pressure of O$`_2`$.
